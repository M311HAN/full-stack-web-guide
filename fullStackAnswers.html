            <h2 id="full-stack">What is full stack web development?</h2>
            <p>
              Full stack web development involves working on both the front-end
              and back-end parts of a website or application. Essentially, it
              covers the entire development process from design to deployment.
              The front-end is what users interact with directly and it includes
              everything they see on their screens, like the layout, design, and
              how they navigate through the site. This part is built using
              languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the other side, the
              back-end is the part of the website you don't see. It's
              responsible for storing and managing data, and making sure
              everything on the front-end works by communicating with the
              server. Back-end developers use languages like PHP, Ruby, Python,
              and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. In web development, a "stack"
              refers to a set of technologies selected to work together in the
              development of web applications. It typically includes programming
              languages, frameworks, database systems, and servers that are used
              for both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side)
              development. Stacks are designed to facilitate a streamlined
              development process, allowing developers to build, test, and
              deploy web applications efficiently. Examples include the MERN
              stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and the LAMP stack
              (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl). In summary a full stack
              developer is someone who has the skills to work on both the
              front-end and back-end. They understand how to make a
              user-friendly website, but also how to handle the data and
              server-side logic that makes it function. This makes them very
              versatile in the web development process.

            <h2 id="php">What is PHP?</h2>
            <p>
              PHP, or PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting
              language designed mainly for web development. It's a powerful tool
              for creating dynamic and interactive websites. Unlike HTML, which
              is client-side and static, PHP code is executed on the server,
              allowing it to generate dynamic page content, manage databases,
              and perform a variety of other server-side tasks before sending
              the final page to the user's web browser. This language is
              particularly user-friendly for new programmers because of its
              straightforward syntax and extensive documentation. PHP integrates
              seamlessly with HTML, making it easy to add dynamic content to web
              pages without needing to use a lot of complex programming
              constructs. It's also highly flexible, supporting a wide range of
              databases and other web development technologies. PHP's
              open-source nature means it's free to use and has a large, active
              community of developers. This community has produced a whole bunch
              of tutorials, forums, and pre-built modules, which can help solve
              common web development problems and add sophisticated features to
              sites without needing to reinvent the wheel. One of the reasons
              PHP is so popular is its ability to interact with databases,
              making it an excellent choice for developing web applications that
              need to store and retrieve data, like e-commerce sites, forums,
              and content management systems. The language has been around since
              1994, and over the years, it has evolved to include many modern
              programming features, making it powerful enough to run major
              websites while still being simple enough for beginners to learn as
              their first server-side language.

            <h2 id="wordpress">Exactly how customisable is WordPress?</h2>
            <p>
              WordPress is highly customisable, making it a popular choice for
              creating a wide range of websites, from simple blogs to complex
              e-commerce platforms. Its flexibility lies in several key
              features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Themes:</b> WordPress offers thousands of themes, which are
                templates that control the appearance of a website. These themes
                can be easily installed and switched, allowing users to change
                the look and feel of their site with just a few clicks. Many
                themes are highly customizable within the WordPress dashboard,
                letting users modify colors, layout, and features without
                needing to write any code. For more advanced customizations,
                users can edit the theme's code directly or create a child theme
                to modify while preserving the ability to update the parent
                theme.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Plugins:</b> The WordPress plugin ecosystem is huge, with
                over 50,000 free plugins available in the WordPress plugin
                directory alone. Plugins extend the functionality of a WordPress
                site, adding features like contact forms, SEO tools, social
                media integration, galleries, and much more. If there's a
                specific functionality you need, there's likely a plugin
                available for it. And if not, developers can create custom
                plugins to meet their specific requirements.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Widgets:</b> Widgets offer another way to customise WordPress
                sites by adding content and features to widget-ready areas, such
                as sidebars and footers. Widgets can include simple text boxes,
                search bars, recent post lists, custom menus, and more,
                providing a simple interface for adding content blocks without
                needing to code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Custom Post Types and Taxonomies:</b> WordPress allows for
                the creation of custom post types and taxonomies, enabling users
                to go beyond posts and pages to create content types that are
                specific to their site's needs, such as products, reviews, or
                portfolio projects. This feature is especially powerful for
                creating structured content and organizing it in a way that
                makes sense for the site's audience.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Page Builders:</b> For those who want more control over their
                site's layout without delving into code, page builders offer a
                drag-and-drop interface to create custom page layouts. Many page
                builders work seamlessly with WordPress, allowing users to
                design unique pages with columns, sliders, tabs, and other
                elements without any coding knowledge.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Access to Code:</b> WordPress is open-source software, which
                means that users have full access to the code that runs their
                site. This allows for deep customizations by those with the
                technical skill to do so. Developers can modify virtually every
                aspect of the site, from the front-end design to the back-end
                functionality.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In summary, WordPress's customisability is extensive, catering to
              users with varying levels of technical expertise. Whether through
              themes, plugins, widgets, page builders, or direct code edits,
              users can tailor their WordPress site to meet almost any design or
              functional requirement.

            <h2 id="mern-stack">What is the MERN stack?</h2>
            <p>
              The MERN stack is a combination of technologies used for web
              application development. It includes MongoDB, Express.js,
              React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB serves as the database, offering a
              flexible, JSON-like storage. Express.js and Node.js form the
              backend, handling server-side tasks and enabling JavaScript to run
              server-side. React.js is used for the frontend, creating dynamic
              and interactive user interfaces. This stack is popular for its
              efficiency in building full-stack applications with JavaScript
              across both client and server sides.

              What types of server functions are typically implemented for the
              back-end of a web application?
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the back-end of a web application, various server functions are
              crucial for its operation. A web server handles HTTP requests from
              clients, delivering web content like HTML pages. An application
              server goes further by running applications, executing server-side
              scripts to generate dynamic content, and managing business logic.
              A proxy server acts as an intermediary, forwarding requests
              between clients and other servers for various purposes like load
              balancing, privacy, or security enhancements. Each plays a
              distinct role in managing, processing, and delivering web content
              efficiently.

              What happens when a browser is used to send a request to a server?
              How does this differ with SSR and CSR?
            </h2>
            <p>
              When a browser sends a request to a server, it's asking for the
              data needed to load a webpage. In Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the
              server prepares and sends a fully rendered page to the browser,
              ready for display. This process can enhance SEO and initial page
              load times. Client-Side Rendering (CSR), conversely, sends a
              minimal HTML document with JavaScript to the browser, where the
              rendering of the page content occurs. CSR can result in smoother
              user experiences with dynamic content but can lead to slower
              initial page loads because the browser must first download, parse,
              and execute JavaScript before rendering the page content. This
              delay can affect user experience, especially on mobile devices or
              slow internet connections. Additionally, CSR presents challenges
              for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because search engines may
              have difficulty indexing content that is dynamically rendered with
              JavaScript, potentially impacting a site's visibility and rankings
              in search results.
